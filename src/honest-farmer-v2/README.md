The devs of the previous pool seem to have learned the lesson. And released a new version!

Now theyâ€™re using a simpler collateral token - ETH. That should be enough.

Users can now borrow a stablecoin - crvUSD. To do so, they first need to deposit twice the borrow amount in ETH as collateral. When the value of the collateral drop below a certain threshold, a third party can liquidate the borrower's position and receive a bounty.

The pool had 100,000 crvUSD in liquidity, supplied by... different, honest farmers. You had $50,000 worth of ETH and borrowed the 100,000 crvUSD.

But now ETH is dumping below the allowed threshold, you don't have the cash to pay back the loan, your parents will not lend you anymore money, and you are about to get liquidated.

Pass the challenge by not getting liquidated.
