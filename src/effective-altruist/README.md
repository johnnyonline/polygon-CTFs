A yield optimization protocol is launching a new vault that allows users to deposit crvUSD and earn rewards.

You happen to follow the deployer address of that protocol, and so you're the first one who has access to that new vault.

You have a balance of 10 crvUSD.

Alice will deposit 10,000 crvUSD, after you've already had the chance to interact with the vault. She expects to get 10,000 shares.

Pass the challange by rugging Alice's deposit, so that she gets less than 10,000 shares.
